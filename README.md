MERN Stack Authentication with JWT: Complete Guide | Registration, Login, Profile, Protected Routes

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll build a full authentication system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication. This tutorial covers everything from user registration to managing protected routes.

In this tutorial, I'll guide you through creating a full authentication system using the MERN stack. Below is a summary of the key steps we’ll cover:

Backend Setup:

Project Setup: Initialize the project and set up the backend with Express.js and MongoDB.
Install Dependencies: npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors nodemon
Create Server and Middleware: Set up the Express server, configure MongoDB, and create necessary middleware.
Create Routes and Endpoints: Develop and test routes for /login, /register, and /profile.
Create Models and Test APIs: Define MongoDB models and test the authentication APIs.
Frontend Setup:

Project Setup: Initialize the frontend using React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
Install Dependencies: npm install axios react-toastify react-router-dom.
Create Components and UI: Build components like Header, Home, Login, Register, and Profile, and set up routing.
Create Private Routes: Implement protected routes to secure the Profile page.
Protecting Routes:

To secure the routes, create a PrivateRoute.js component to handle access control for authenticated users.
This tutorial provides a complete guide to setting up and securing a MERN stack application with JWT. Follow along to build your authentication system from scratch!


Key Features:

Backend: Implementing RESTful APIs with Express.js.
Frontend: Building a responsive UI with React.js and Tailwind CSS.
Database: Storing user data in MongoDB.
Authentication: Managing JWT tokens for secure login, registration, and profile protection.
Protected Routes: Ensuring only authenticated users can access specific parts of your application.
